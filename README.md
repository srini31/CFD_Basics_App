# CFD_Basics_App
A Client/Server Application that solves problems in 2D

The idea is to create a simple Client/Server application using a Java client and a C++/Python server to solve 2D problems in CFD. 
While the commercial and other open source softwares are more high level, to understand the basics 2D is a good starting point. 2D problems help one understand to solve a theoretical formula using finite difference methods, give understanding of meshing etc. 

The UI will initially be minimal. For post processing using colorful images, Python and Java have graphics libraries that can be used.
The material will be used from Suhas Patankars CFD book.
